      {
        "question": "How often should I use shampoo?",
        "answer": "It's generally recommended to wash your hair with shampoo 2-3 times per week. However, this may vary depending on your hair type and lifestyle. Those with oily hair might shampoo daily, while those with dry or curly hair may shampoo less often."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I apply shampoo to dry or wet hair?",
        "answer": "Always apply shampoo to wet hair. Start by thoroughly soaking your hair with water before applying shampoo to ensure it lathers well and cleans effectively."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much shampoo should I use?",
        "answer": "Use a coin-sized amount for short hair, and adjust the amount based on your hair length and thickness. Using too much can leave residue, while too little may not clean adequately."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use shampoo as a body wash?",
        "answer": "Shampoo is formulated specifically for hair and may not be ideal for skin. While it may not harm you in an emergency, it's best to use a body wash, as shampoo may not effectively cleanse or moisturize skin."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to shampoo twice in one wash?",
        "answer": "Double shampooing can be beneficial if you use heavy styling products or have oily hair. The first wash removes buildup, and the second ensures a deep clean. However, it’s not necessary for everyone and may dry out some hair types."
