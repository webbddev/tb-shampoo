        "descriptionSubtitle": "Deep and gentle cleansing from all unnecessary microparticles and impurities",
        "description1": "Insufficient removal of styling residues, sebum, and urban dirt before applying new styling products leads to a buildup of impurities. This limits the access of oxygen and nutrients, negatively affecting the condition of the hair. As a result, hair loses vitality, becomes dull, and more brittle. This is why deep but gentle cleansing is so important. Salicylic acid in the shampoo removes previous styling, urban dirt, excess sebum, and dandruff particles, gently cleansing the scalp and regulating sebum production. Assisting it is lactic acid - a natural alpha hydroxy acid. With a mild exfoliating effect, lactic acid stimulates the production of protective lipids. These components ensure perfect hair cleanliness, freeing it from styling residues and sebum, while effectively addressing the problem of seborrhea.",

        "descriptionSubtitle": "Enhanced hair nourishment is the key to strength, shine, and elasticity!",
        "description1": "Thoroughly cleansed hair creates ideal conditions for hydration, nourishment, and, consequently, for strength and resilience. Without the supply of essential nutrients such as amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, the internal structure of the hair may begin to break down. This leads to fragility and breakage, highlighting the importance of amino acid nourishment. AMINO ACIZI is a treasure trove of amino acids. Keratin provides strength and structure to the hair; arginine improves blood circulation and stimulates growth; cysteine restores damaged hair and promotes keratin production; glycine hydrates and improves texture; leucine supports tissue repair and hair health.",

        "description1": "The Amino Acizi shampoo formula contains Panthenol (provitamin B5), known for its moisturizing properties. It penetrates the hair shaft, improving its elasticity and strength. Panthenol also soothes the scalp, promoting the healing of microcracks and irritations, making it an ideal ingredient for sensitive or damaged skin. Urea helps retain moisture, preventing dryness and flaking. This ingredient has keratolytic properties, gently exfoliating dead skin cells. Menthol creates a refreshing sensation and improves scalp microcirculation, enhancing the nutrition of hair follicles. Menthol also has mild antiseptic properties and soothes irritated skin.",

        "description1": "pH 6-7 is as close as possible to the natural acid-alkaline balance of hair and skin, which truly brings a range of benefits. Gentler effect - a pH in this range minimizes the risk of cuticle damage, which is important for maintaining hair health. Improved hydration - a neutral pH level promotes better moisture retention, leaving hair more hydrated and less prone to drying out. Lipid barrier restoration - maintaining the correct pH level helps preserve and restore the natural lipid barrier of the scalp, which is important for protection against external influences. Irritation prevention - avoiding excessive alkaline or acidic exposure can reduce the risk of irritation and allergic reactions. Maintaining natural balance - pH 6-7 helps sustain the natural microflora of the scalp, which is important for its health.",
        "description2": "As a result, hair appears shinier, smoother, and stronger. It tangles less and is easier to style, making pH 6-7 a winning choice for hair care. Give your hair what it truly needs!"

      {
        "question": "How often should I use shampoo?",
        "answer": "It's generally recommended to wash your hair with shampoo 2-3 times per week. However, this may vary depending on your hair type and lifestyle. Those with oily hair might shampoo daily, while those with dry or curly hair may shampoo less often."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I apply shampoo to dry or wet hair?",
        "answer": "Always apply shampoo to wet hair. Start by thoroughly soaking your hair with water before applying shampoo to ensure it lathers well and cleans effectively."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much shampoo should I use?",
        "answer": "Use a coin-sized amount for short hair, and adjust the amount based on your hair length and thickness. Using too much can leave residue, while too little may not clean adequately."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use shampoo as a body wash?",
        "answer": "Shampoo is formulated specifically for hair and may not be ideal for skin. While it may not harm you in an emergency, it's best to use a body wash, as shampoo may not effectively cleanse or moisturize skin."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to shampoo twice in one wash?",
        "answer": "Double shampooing can be beneficial if you use heavy styling products or have oily hair. The first wash removes buildup, and the second ensures a deep clean. However, it’s not necessary for everyone and may dry out some hair types."
