        "descriptionSubtitle": "Deep and gentle cleansing from all unnecessary microparticles and impurities",
        "description1": "Insufficient removal of styling residues, sebum, and urban dirt before applying new styling products leads to a buildup of impurities. This limits the access of oxygen and nutrients, negatively affecting the condition of the hair. As a result, hair loses vitality, becomes dull, and more brittle. This is why deep but gentle cleansing is so important. Salicylic acid in the shampoo removes previous styling, urban dirt, excess sebum, and dandruff particles, gently cleansing the scalp and regulating sebum production. Assisting it is lactic acid - a natural alpha hydroxy acid. With a mild exfoliating effect, lactic acid stimulates the production of protective lipids. These components ensure perfect hair cleanliness, freeing it from styling residues and sebum, while effectively addressing the problem of seborrhea.",

        "descriptionSubtitle": "Enhanced hair nourishment is the key to strength, shine, and elasticity!",
        "description1": "Thoroughly cleansed hair creates ideal conditions for hydration, nourishment, and, consequently, for strength and resilience. Without the supply of essential nutrients such as amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, the internal structure of the hair may begin to break down. This leads to fragility and breakage, highlighting the importance of amino acid nourishment. AMINO ACIZI is a treasure trove of amino acids. Keratin provides strength and structure to the hair; arginine improves blood circulation and stimulates growth; cysteine restores damaged hair and promotes keratin production; glycine hydrates and improves texture; leucine supports tissue repair and hair health.",
        "description2": "Thanks to this amino acid complex, hair is transformed before your eyes. It becomes strong, hydrated, and radiant."

        "description1": "The Amino Acizi shampoo formula contains Panthenol (provitamin B5), known for its moisturizing properties. It penetrates the hair shaft, improving its elasticity and strength. Panthenol also soothes the scalp, promoting the healing of microcracks and irritations, making it an ideal ingredient for sensitive or damaged skin. Urea helps retain moisture, preventing dryness and flaking. This ingredient has keratolytic properties, gently exfoliating dead skin cells. Menthol creates a refreshing sensation and improves scalp microcirculation, enhancing the nutrition of hair follicles. Menthol also has mild antiseptic properties and soothes irritated skin.",

        "descriptionSubtitle": "Be amazed at how gentle and caring this shampoo is!",
        "description1": "pH 6-7 is as close as possible to the natural acid-alkaline balance of hair and skin, which truly brings a range of benefits. Gentler effect - a pH in this range minimizes the risk of cuticle damage, which is important for maintaining hair health. Improved hydration - a neutral pH level promotes better moisture retention, leaving hair more hydrated and less prone to drying out. Lipid barrier restoration - maintaining the correct pH level helps preserve and restore the natural lipid barrier of the scalp, which is important for protection against external influences. Irritation prevention - avoiding excessive alkaline or acidic exposure can reduce the risk of irritation and allergic reactions. Maintaining natural balance - pH 6-7 helps sustain the natural microflora of the scalp, which is important for its health.",
        "description2": "As a result, hair appears shinier, smoother, and stronger. It tangles less and is easier to style, making pH 6-7 a winning choice for hair care. Give your hair what it truly needs!"

      },
      {

        "answer": "Yes, the shampoo gently cleanses and does not wash out the color."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly will the results be visible?",
        "answer": "Improvements are noticeable after the first application, but for maximum effect, regular use is recommended."

      {
        "question": "Is it true that the shampoo helps with seborrhea?",
        "answer": "Yes, it's true. AMINO ACIZI is effective against seborrhea due to its specially selected composition. Salicylic acid, urea, and panthenol work together to have a powerful impact."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is it true that amino acids help restore hair if it's considered \"dead\"?",
        "answer": "Although the visible part of the hair consists of dead cells, this doesn't mean they can't be improved. Amino acids in AMINO ACIZI work as follows: Penetrate the hair structure, filling in micro-damage and strengthening it from the inside. Create a protective film around the hair, preventing further damage. Improve the hair's ability to retain moisture, making it more elastic and less brittle. Restore keratin bonds, improving strength and appearance. Nourish and strengthen hair roots and scalp, promoting the growth of healthier new hair. So, although we can't \"revive\" hair, we can significantly improve its condition and appearance with the amino acids in AMINO ACIZI."

      {
        "question": "How economical is the AMINO ACIZI shampoo?",
        "answer": "Concentrated formula: A small amount is enough for a thorough hair wash."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why doesn't the AMINO ACIZI shampoo lather as much as regular shampoos?",
        "answer": "AMINO ACIZI is created with care for your hair and the environment: Less chemistry - more benefits. We intentionally reduced the amount of artificial foaming agents, preferring natural components. If you find the shampoo doesn't lather enough on your hair, dilute it with a small amount of water in a glass and wash your hair with that water. Our shampoo proves that aggressive chemicals are not needed for hair beauty and health!"
